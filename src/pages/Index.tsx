            We are not here to <span className="text-foreground font-bold">CAMPAIGN</span>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We are here because silence has become convenient for those who benefit from forgetting. In corridors where memory is short and narratives are recycled. What you are being shown is not leadership, but curation. Not accountability, but noise.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And noise, repeated enough times, begins to sound like truth.

              Formal misconduct occurred: leakage of confidential problem statements, and admission in EDAD of being under the influence during an SnT event; the individual was deratified, and disciplinary action was taken. <span className="text-foreground font-bold">DERATIFICATION</span> is being treated as irrelevant, with no public accountability or acknowledgment.

            <li>
              The other candidate <span className="text-foreground font-bold">FAILED MTH114</span> while handling just five courses in the first year; expecting someone with a CPI <span className="text-foreground font-bold">BARELY AROUND 6</span> to manage the academic and administrative load of SnT General Secretary is pretty fucking laughable at best.

            <li>
              Collective achievements of the <span className="text-foreground font-bold">COUNCIL</span> are being portrayed by both as individual merit, <span className="text-foreground font-bold">MISLEADING JUNIOR BATCHES</span>; one of them even placed 14th out of all IITs in his own PS in interIIT Tech Meet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Direct messaging and informal pressure are being used to solicit public endorsement and spread his propaganda picture with all the interIIT trophies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anti-campaigning, narrative control, and image laundering have replaced transparency.
